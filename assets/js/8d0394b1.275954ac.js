The research coordinator along with the surgeon will be able to insert the lumpectomy specimen followed by the 6 shaved margins (one by one) in a matter of minutes once the specimens have been resected. To be clear, the FLIM analysis will be taking place in- vitro. The device is invitro test and would be tested against the gold standard the pathologist biopsy.\\n\\nFLIM analysis by the surgeon will not take more than several minutes, therefore not adding any significant time for patient to be under anesthesia. All specimens will be removed from the patient\'s body prior to their evaluation by the FLIM technique. Our team will not be making decisions based on FLIM analysis during this early phase of study. In other words, even if FLIM suggests a positive margin still exists in the body, our team will not act on these results by resecting additional tissue at this stage.
