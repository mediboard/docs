For these patients, the use of gonadotropins for controlled ovarian stimulation (COS) is indicated.\n\nMoreover, to date it isn't clear if COS should be followed by timed intercourse (TI) or intrauterine insemination (IUI).\n\nThe aim of the present study will be to compare TI and IUI in infertile PCOS patients undergoing COS in terms of cost-benefit.",

While different surgeons use different operative techniques, our technique involves removing the main lumpectomy specimen, marking two of its borders with suture to orient the specimen for correct pathologic evaluation.\n\nThe FLIM (Fluorescent Lifetime Imaging Microscopy) technique can differentiate between cancerous and noncancerous specimens using a complex algorithm that essentially utilizes a definitive delta between the metabolic activities of diseased and non-diseased tissue. The research coordinator along with the surgeon will be able to insert the lumpectomy specimen followed by the 6 shaved margins (one by one) in a matter of minutes once the specimens have been resected. To be clear, the FLIM analysis will be taking place in- vitro. The device is invitro test and would be tested against the gold standard the pathologist biopsy.\n\nFLIM analysis by the surgeon will not take more than several minutes, therefore not adding any significant time for patient to be under anesthesia. All specimens will be removed from the patient's body prior to their evaluation by the FLIM technique. Our team will not be making decisions based on FLIM analysis during this early phase of study. In other words, even if FLIM suggests a positive margin still exists in the body, our team will not act on these results by resecting additional tissue at this stage. FLIM margin results will be compared directly with pathology results for accuracy of the findings.",
